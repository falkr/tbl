# TBL Uniped Module

Team-based learning is a framework that helps you to provide active learning and constructive alignment also in large classes.
In this module, we will introduce you to the elements of team-based learning and how they connect to underlying pedagogic principles.
We will emphasize the constructive and practical aspects of TBL.

"That’s a nice idea, but it just doesn’t work in my course" is something all of us have thought or said at some point.
We will therefore also spend time to figure out what is “so special” about your course, and try to make TBL work for you.
But the goal of this module is not that everyone ends up using TBL. Some will, and some won’t.
Instead, the goal is to make you see how TBL works, as it helps you to understand more about teach- ing and learning, and will provide you with more critical reflection and the skills to change.



## Learning Goals

:goals: After going through this seminar, you will be able to:

- Recite the phases of a TBL unit.
